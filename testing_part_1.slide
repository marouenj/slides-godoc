Ideas about testing

* Agenda

- Test data management issues
- Test data management solution
- Test coverage
- Spring Mock MVC
- Minor ideas

* Test data management issues / scope #1

    public class DefaultTest {
        private final static ID = "id";
        ...
    }

- Data is mixed with other utilities (mocking objects, logger, ...)

* Test data management issues / scope #2

    public class BaseTest {
        protected final static ID = ...

        protected ... getTestData() {
            ...
        }
    }

    public class DefaultTest extends BaseTest {
        ...
    }

- Inheretence is a bad candidate for data re-usage
- It doesn't offer a fine-grained grouping of data
- This will eventually lead to a big data container
- Hard to make sense out of and collaborate on

* Test data management issues / scope #3

    public class BaseTest {

        @Test
        public void do() {
            id = ...
            ...
        }
    }

- Data preparation is mixed with test logic

* Test data management issues / scope #4
- Leveraging the scopes provided by Java for data re-usage doens't scale
- As a developer, I need to rely on manual tracking to identify test data for a particular test

* Test data management issues / test function per test case

- AKA duplication of logic (data preparation logic and test logic)

    public class DefaultTest {
        @Test
        public void shouldDefaultToFalseWhen...() {
        }

        @Test
        public void shouldBeValid() {
        }

        @Test
        public void shouldThrowAnExceptionWhen...() {
        }
        ...
    }

Lots of efforts to:
- scroll down
- size up coverage for a particular situation (what test cases have been covered, what's missing)
- avoid duplication of tests

* Test data management solution / data-driven testing

- Really decouples data from test logic
- Scalable (one container of data per test)
- One entry per test case
- Entry = input data + expected
- Multiple test cases, one logic for data prepration, one logic for testing

* Test data management solution / TestNG #1

- Inspired by JUnit but adds more
- Data-driven testing through @DataProvider annotation
- Data container is a method annotated with @DataProvider
- Test method sees test data through method arguments (injection = complete decoupling)

* Test data management solution / TestNG #2

    @DataProvider(name = "shouldSumUp")
    public Object[][] shouldSumUp() {
        // data definition
        // logic for grouping the data
    }

    @Test(dataProvider = "shouldSumUp")
    public void shouldSumUp(Integer[] vals, Integer expected) {
        // logic for retrieving the data
        // test logic
    }

* Test data management solution / TestNG #3

To integrate TestNG with JUnit in a Gradle project

    dependencies {
        testCompile 'org.testng:testng:6.9.10'
    }

    task testNG (type: Test) {
        useTestNG {}
        reports.html.destination = file("$buildDir/reports/testsng")
    }

    test {
        dependsOn testNG
    }

* Test coverage

* Spring Mock MVC
